# User Experience Improvements for Academic Teams

## Current UX Assessment: GOOD ⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Academic Workflow Analysis

#### Strengths
✅ SPARC methodology aligns with research workflows  
✅ Multi-agent collaboration mirrors academic teams
✅ Version control integration supports collaborative research  
✅ Automated documentation generation
✅ Flexible agent specialization

#### Pain Points Identified
❌ Steep learning curve for non-technical researchers
❌ Limited templates for academic use cases
❌ No integration with academic databases (PubMed, arXiv, etc.)
❌ Missing citation management capabilities
❌ No collaborative review workflows

### Improvement Recommendations

#### 1. Academic-Specific Agent Templates
```javascript
// Proposed new agent types
const academicAgents = [
  'literature-reviewer',     // Systematic literature reviews
  'data-analyst',           // Statistical analysis and visualization  
  'citation-manager',       // Reference management and formatting
  'methodology-validator',  // Research methodology review
  'peer-reviewer',          // Academic peer review workflows
  'grant-writer',          // Research proposal assistance
  'ethics-reviewer'        // Research ethics compliance
];
```

#### 2. Academic Workflow Templates
- **Literature Review Workflow**: Automated paper discovery, summarization, and synthesis
- **Systematic Review Protocol**: PRISMA-compliant systematic review management
- **Data Analysis Pipeline**: Statistical analysis with reproducible reporting
- **Manuscript Preparation**: Multi-author collaborative writing with version control
- **Grant Application Support**: Proposal writing with compliance checking

#### 3. Integration Recommendations
```yaml
academic_integrations:
  databases:
    - PubMed/MEDLINE
    - arXiv  
    - IEEE Xplore
    - ACM Digital Library
    - Google Scholar
  
  reference_managers:
