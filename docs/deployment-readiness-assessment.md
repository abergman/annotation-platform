## 4. Sensitive Information Audit

### ❌ CRITICAL: Environment Files with Secrets Found
```bash
/home/andreas/Code/annotation/config/.env.production
/home/andreas/Code/annotation/deployment/environments/.env.production
/home/andreas/Code/annotation/deployment/environments/.env.staging
/home/andreas/Code/annotation/frontend/.env.production
```

### ✅ Properly Excluded Files:
- `.env` files properly gitignored
- No API keys in source code
- Template files provided for configuration
- Secrets managed through environment variables

### Recommended Actions:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Remove all `.env.production` files from repository
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Rotate any exposed secrets
3. Use CI/CD environment variable injection
4. Consider using secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

## Conclusion

The Academic Annotation Platform demonstrates strong architectural foundations and is largely ready for production deployment. The comprehensive Docker setup, security implementations, and testing infrastructure provide a solid foundation for a production system.

**Primary concerns** center around secret management and incomplete access control implementations, which must be addressed before deployment. Once these critical issues are resolved, the application should perform well in a production environment.

**Recommended deployment timeline**: 2-3 days for critical fixes, then proceed with staged deployment (staging → production).
